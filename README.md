🕵️ Zen Tab Sorter Agent: The Secret Agent of Order

Tab Sorter isn't just a browser extension. It's your personal secret agent, covertly living inside your tabs, fighting chaos, and enforcing order. It has a serious case of OCD and simply cannot tolerate tabs being out of place.

Its mission? To sort all your tabs alphabetically. First, by URL, and then, for perfect precision, by page title. Now your tabs will always be exactly where they're supposed to be.

✨ Features

* **Autosort tabs** on open / update / activation.

* **Sorting rules:**
  * By domain
  * Then by title (alphabetical order).
* **Duplicates:** automatically closed
* **Hotkey:** `Alt+S` — manual sort on demand.
* **Respect for Zen specifics:** pinned and Essential Tabs are ignored.
* **Range-based sorting:** sorts only within the block of normal tabs, without moving pinned or special Zen sections.

## 🛠 Usage

* Open new tabs — they will automatically jump into the correct sorted position.
* If you move tabs manually, press `Alt+S` to re-sort them.
* Duplicates of the same URL are automatically closed.

🤝 Compatibility

This agent is currently on duty in Firefox and Zen Browser.
