🕵️ Tab Sorter: The Secret Agent of Order

Tab Sorter isn't just a browser extension. It's your personal secret agent, covertly living inside your tabs, fighting chaos, and enforcing order. It has a serious case of OCD and simply cannot tolerate tabs being out of place.

Its mission? To sort all your tabs alphabetically. First, by URL, and then, for perfect precision, by page title. Now your tabs will always be exactly where they're supposed to be.
